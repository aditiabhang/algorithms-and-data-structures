    "- If we call Big O the worst case scenario, then Big Omega is the best case scenario or the super lucky scenario. A simple example: What is the best scenario in case of sorting an array of a size N using Bubble sort? The best case is if the array was already sorted! and for the Bubble sort algorithm, it takes one iteration over the array (From 0 to N-1) to find out that it is indeed sorted. Therefore Big Omega of Bubble sort is Î©(n)."
